# Summary

``eddy`` is a Python package which implements several methods for extracting kinematical information from astronomical observations of Doppler shifted molecular line emission in accretion disks. Such kinematic information is essential for constraining the physical structure of the accretion disk and, for the case of protoplanetary disks, searching for evidence of embedded planets [@Teague:2018].

Basic functionality includes two types of analysis: either for full 2D rotation maps, or for an annulus of spectra extracted from an observation. The former can be fit with a Keplerian rotation profile to highlight any azimuthal structure in disk, while the second implements several techniques for inferring the rotation velocity of the annulus.
